    <h2>This key work in Javascript</h2>

    <p class="main-text">
      A function's <strong>this</strong> keyword behaves a little differently in
      JavaScript compared to other languages. It also has some differences
      between strict mode and non-strict mode. In most cases, the value of this
      is determined by how a function is called (runtime binding). It can't be
      set by assignment during execution, and it may be different each time the
      function is called. ES5 introduced the bind() method to set the value of a
      function's this regardless of how it's called, and ES2015 introduced arrow
      functions which don't provide their own this binding (it retains the this
      value of the enclosing lexical context).

    <h2>Currying Function in Javascript</h2>
    <p class="main-text">
      <em> Currying refers to the process of transforming </em> a function with
      multiple arity into the same function with less arity. The curried effect
      is achieved by binding some of the arguments to the first function invoke,
      so that those values are fixed for the next invocation. Here’s an example
      of what a curried function looks like:

    <h2>Clouser in Javascript</h2>
    <p class="main-text">
      <em> A closure is the combination of a function bundled together </em
      >(enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical
      environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer
      function’s scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are
      created every time a function is created, at function creation time. To
      use a closure, define a function inside another function and expose it. To
      expose a function, return it or pass it to another function. The inner
      function will have access to the variables in the outer function scope,
      even after the outer function has returned.
